# Git ER (Preventing visits to the Emergency Room since 2017)

When one has git repos dispersed across one's system, it can be hard to keep
them all synced. Well fear not now that Git ER will keep everything working like
a charm with a simple, yet powerful script.

# Instructions
1. You can start by adding the full file path to your Git repositories in the
   watchList.txt file.
2. Now simply run "python sync.py" and everything should function appropriately.
